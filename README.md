This project was made with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

[live demo](http://skrypty.waw.pl/scientific-calculator/)

JS libraries that were used:
- [mathjs](http://mathjs.org/index.html) for calculations
- [he](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he) decoding html entities, so instead of * there is <span>'&times;'</span>

Cleaned with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
